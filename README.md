Electric Vehicle Range and Charging Station Finder

This Python project calculates the nearest electric vehicle (EV) charging station, performs hypothesis testing on the vehicle’s range, and generates a map with the route to the nearest station. The project is designed to help EV owners manage their vehicle’s range more effectively by analyzing real-world data and providing insights on whether the vehicle can reach a nearby charging station.

Features

	•	Hypothesis Testing: Tests whether the vehicle’s range is consistent with the manufacturer’s claims using real-world data.
	•	Charging Station Finder: Uses the Google Places API to find nearby EV charging stations.
	•	Route Calculation: Retrieves driving directions and calculates the distance to the nearest charging station using the Google Maps Directions API.
	•	Performance Adjustment: Suggests performance adjustments to extend the vehicle’s range if the nearest charging station is out of reach.
	•	Map Generation: Creates an interactive map showing the vehicle’s location, nearby charging stations, and the route to the nearest station.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x
	•	requests library
	•	folium library
	•	numpy library
	•	scipy library
	•	A valid Google Maps API key


	
Map Output

•The map will display the vehicle’s location, nearby charging stations, and the route to the nearest station, with color-coded markers for easy identification.
